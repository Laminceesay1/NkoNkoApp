**The Open-Source Mandinka Learning Platform**

## 🌍 Mission
Nko Nko App is an open-source project dedicated to preserving and teaching the Mandinka language to diaspora kids, learners, and anyone passionate about West African culture.  
Our vision is to make learning Mandinka **fun, free, kid-safe, and community-powered** — just like Duolingo, but entirely open-source and without ads.

## ✨ What Makes Nko Nko Special
- **Open Source:** Anyone can contribute lessons, translations, and ideas.
- **Kid-Safe:** No ads, no distractions, just pure learning.
- **Gamified Learning:** Points, streaks, and challenges to keep learners engaged.
- **Community Recognition:** Top contributors are celebrated publicly.
- **Cultural Depth:** Learn not only the words but the stories, proverbs, and traditions.

## 📚 How It Works
1. Start with **beginner lessons** (greetings, family, numbers, colors).
2. Progress to **intermediate** (verbs, grammar, common phrases).
3. Explore **advanced** content (proverbs, stories, idioms).
4. Continuous learning as contributors add more lessons.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
